## Keyboard Shortcuts

DroidDock supports these keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation and file management:

| Shortcut | Action |

## Troubleshooting

### ADB Not Found

If the app can't find ADB:

1. **Install ADB** via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install android-platform-tools
   ```

2. **Or set a custom path**:
   - The app will show a setup screen
   - Enter the full path to your ADB executable (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/adb`)
   - Click "Set Path"

### Device Not Showing Up

- Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device
- Check if device is recognized: `adb devices`
- Try clicking the "Refresh" button in the app
- You may need to accept the debugging authorization prompt on your device

### Permission Errors When Browsing

- Some system directories require root access
- Try browsing user-accessible directories like `/storage/emulated/0` or `/sdcard`

### Can't Navigate Into Folders

- **Single-click** on the folder name (the blue text) to open it
- Wait for the loading indicator to finish
- Note: Clicking elsewhere on the row selects the folder instead of opening it

## Development

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

Changes to React files will hot-reload automatically. Changes to Rust files will trigger recompilation.

### Build Production App

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Frontend tests
npm test

# Rust tests
cd src-tauri && cargo test
```

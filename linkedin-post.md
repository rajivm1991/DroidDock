## From Software Engineer to Mountain Teacher 🏔️ → Still Building 🚀

After 12 years as a software engineer, I made a life-changing decision to become a teacher in the Paahad (mountains). Life isn't all about chasing money – I've found peace working with kids in the hills, and I'm genuinely happy.

But old habits die hard! 😄

While teaching mathematics and doing part-time freelance software work, I found myself frustrated with the lack of free, open-source tools for browsing Android files on macOS. Everything out there was either paid or bloated.

So, I built **DroidDock** – a clean, modern macOS app for browsing your Android phone's files via ADB.

## Why DroidDock?

- ✅ **100% Free & Open Source** (MIT License)
- ✅ **Native macOS App** built with Tauri + Rust
- ✅ **No ads, no tracking, no subscriptions**
- ✅ **Lightweight & Fast** – does one thing well

## Current Features

- 📂 Browse Android device files with a clean, modern UI
- 🔄 Navigate directories with breadcrumb navigation
- 👁️ Show/hide hidden files toggle
- 🖼️ **Image & Video Thumbnails** (with lazy loading for performance)
- 🌓 Dark mode support
- 📱 Auto-detect storage paths across different Android devices

## Coming Soon

- 📥 File Download - Pull files from device to Mac
- 📤 File Upload - Push files from Mac to device
- 🗑️ File Deletion - Delete files on device
- 🔍 Search - Search for files by name
- 📷 File Preview - Preview images and text files
- 💾 Drag & Drop - Drag files to/from the app
- 📱 Multiple Devices - View multiple devices simultaneously
- ⏱️ File Sync - Sync files between Mac and Android

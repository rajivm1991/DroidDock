I Moved to the Mountains to Slow Down… Then I Built Something Fast. 🏔️💻

After 12 years as a software engineer, I left to become a teacher in the Paahad (mountains). Life isn't all about chasing money. I've found peace working with kids in the hills.

But old habits die hard. 😄

While teaching mathematics and doing part-time freelance work, I got frustrated — there wasn't a free, clean way to browse Android files on macOS.

Everything was either paid, clunky, or bloated.

So I built DroidDock — a lightweight, modern macOS app for exploring Android device files via ADB.

✨ Why DroidDock?
✅ 100% Free & Open Source (MIT License)
✅ Native macOS app built with Tauri + Rust
✅ No ads, no tracking, no subscriptions
✅ Lightweight, fast, and focused — does one thing well

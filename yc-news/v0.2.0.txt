Show HN: DroidDock – Browse Android files on Mac with a Finder-like experience

Hi HN! I'm excited to share DroidDock, a macOS app I built for browsing Android device files.

The Problem

As a Mac user with an Android phone, I was tired of using adb pull/push commands just to transfer files. Tools like Android File Transfer are clunky and haven't been updated in years. I wanted something that felt more Mac-like – fast, keyboard-driven, and intuitive.

What It Does

DroidDock is essentially Finder for your Android device:

* Browse files with Table, Grid, or Column (Miller) views
* Preview images and text files without downloading (press Space!)
* Navigate with keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, Cmd+1/2/3)
* Search files recursively across directories
* Upload/download with file picker
* Multi-select, delete, and manage files
* Dark mode support
* Auto-updates built-in

Tech Stack

Built with Tauri (Rust backend) + React/TypeScript frontend. Why Tauri?

* Good performance (Rust handles all ADB communication)
* Small bundle size (~15MB DMG for universal binary)
* Lower memory footprint than Electron
* Built-in auto-updater with signature verification

The entire file browsing logic and ADB interaction runs in Rust, while React handles the UI. Communication happens through Tauri's command system (like IPC but type-safe).

What's New in v0.2.0

Just released this week:

* File preview system (images + text files) - press Space to preview
* Keyboard navigation in preview modal (arrow keys to browse)
* "Kind" column in table view (Image, Video, Document, etc.)
* Enhanced keyboard navigation (Space for quick preview)
* Simplified from 4 view modes to 3 (Table, Grid, Column)
* Better focus management and selection behavior

Challenges

1. ADB Path Detection: Different package managers install ADB in different locations (Homebrew, MacPorts, Android Studio). Had to check 5+ common paths on startup.
2. Thumbnail Generation: Android doesn't expose a thumbnail API via ADB. I pull the first N bytes of image files, decode them in Rust, and generate thumbnails on-the-fly with caching.
3. File Preview: ADB doesn't stream files – you have to pull the entire file. For large images, I had to implement chunked reading to check dimensions/size before deciding whether to pull.
4. Code Signing: Currently unsigned (requires $99/year Apple Developer membership). Users have to right-click → Open on first launch.
5. WebView Limitations: Unlike a true native app (Swift/AppKit), I'm constrained by WebView capabilities. But for a file browser, it's been perfectly adequate and much faster to develop.

Open Source & Free

MIT licensed, no telemetry, no ads. Just a tool I wanted for myself.

Would love feedback! This is my first Tauri app after years of building Electron apps. The Rust learning curve was worth it – much smaller bundles and better performance for file I/O. Happy to answer questions!

Show HN: DroidDock – Browse Android files on Mac with a Finder-like experience

Hi HN! I'm excited to share DroidDock, a macOS app I built for browsing Android device files.

The Problem

As a Mac user with an Android phone, I was tired of using adb pull/push commands just to transfer files. Tools like Android File Transfer are clunky and haven't been updated in years. I wanted something that felt more Mac-like – fast, keyboard-driven, and intuitive.

What It Does

DroidDock is essentially Finder for your Android device:

* Browse files with Table, Grid, or Column (Miller) views
* Preview images and text files without downloading (press Space!)
* Navigate with keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, Cmd+1/2/3)
* Clickable column headers for sorting (Name, Size, Date)
* Search files recursively across directories
* Upload/download with drag-and-drop or file picker
* Multi-select, delete, and manage files
* Dark mode with minimalist grayscale design
* Auto-updates built-in

Tech Stack

Built with Tauri (Rust backend) + React/TypeScript frontend. Why Tauri?

* Good performance (Rust handles all ADB communication)
* Small bundle size (~15MB DMG for universal binary)
* Lower memory footprint than Electron
* Built-in auto-updater with signature verification

The entire file browsing logic and ADB interaction runs in Rust, while React handles the UI. Communication happens through Tauri's command system (like IPC but type-safe).

What's New in v0.2.1

Just released today:

* Minimalist UI redesign with 95% grayscale aesthetic
* Clickable column headers for sorting (click Name/Size/Date columns)
* Sort controls moved to main header (more discoverable)
* Simplified zoom controls (2 buttons instead of 4, works with Cmd+/Cmd−)
* New playful Android robot icon
* Better date column readability (monospace font, wider width)
* Clean Unicode symbols instead of emoji (↻ ↑ − + ⋯)

Challenges

1. ADB Path Detection: Different package managers install ADB in different locations (Homebrew, MacPorts, Android Studio). Had to check 5+ common paths on startup.
2. Thumbnail Generation: Android doesn't expose a thumbnail API via ADB. I pull the first N bytes of image files, decode them in Rust, and generate thumbnails on-the-fly with caching.
3. File Preview: ADB doesn't stream files – you have to pull the entire file. For large images, I had to implement chunked reading to check dimensions/size before deciding whether to pull.
4. Code Signing: Currently unsigned (requires $99/year Apple Developer membership). Users have to right-click → Open on first launch.
5. WebView Limitations: Unlike a true native app (Swift/AppKit), I'm constrained by WebView capabilities. But for a file browser, it's been perfectly adequate and much faster to develop.

Open Source & Free

MIT licensed, no telemetry, no ads. Just a tool I wanted for myself.

Would love feedback! This is my first Tauri app after years of building Electron apps. The Rust learning curve was worth it – much smaller bundles and better performance for file I/O. Happy to answer questions!

= = = = shorter version for updates

DroidDock v0.2.1 is out! New in this release:

* Minimalist UI redesign – 95% grayscale aesthetic, clean and professional
* Clickable column headers for sorting (just click Name, Size, or Date)
* Simplified zoom controls (2 buttons: − and +, works with Cmd+/Cmd−)
* New playful Android robot app icon
* Better table view with improved date column readability

Still MIT licensed, free, no telemetry. Built with Tauri (Rust + React).

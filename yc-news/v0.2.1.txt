Show HN: DroidDock – Browse Android files on Mac with a Finder-like experience

Hi HN! I'm excited to share DroidDock, a macOS app I built for browsing Android device files.

The Problem

As a Mac user with an Android phone, I was tired of using adb pull/push commands just to transfer files. Tools like Android File Transfer are clunky and haven't been updated in years. I wanted something that felt more Mac-like – fast, keyboard-driven, and intuitive.

What It Does

DroidDock is essentially Finder for your Android device:

* Browse files with Table, Grid, or Column (Miller) views
* Preview images and text files without downloading (press Space!)
* Navigate with keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, Cmd+1/2/3)
* Clickable column headers for sorting
* Search files recursively across directories
* Upload/download with drag-and-drop or file picker
* Multi-select, delete, and manage files
* Dark mode support

Tech Stack

Built with Tauri (Rust backend) + React/TypeScript frontend. Why Tauri?

* Good performance (Rust handles all ADB communication)
* Small bundle size (~15MB DMG for universal binary)
* Lower memory footprint than Electron
* Built-in auto-updater

The entire file browsing logic and ADB interaction runs in Rust, while React handles the UI.

What's New in v0.2.x

* **File Previews**: Press Space to preview images/text without downloading
* **Minimalist UI**: Clean 95% grayscale design with better readability
* **Clickable Sorting**: Click column headers (Name, Size, Date) to sort
* **Kind Column**: Shows file types at a glance (Image, Video, Document, etc.)
* **Better Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys in preview, Cmd shortcuts for everything

Challenges

1. ADB Path Detection: Different package managers install ADB in different locations. Had to check 5+ common paths on startup.
2. Thumbnail Generation: Android doesn't expose a thumbnail API via ADB. I pull the first N bytes of image files and generate thumbnails on-the-fly with caching.
3. File Preview: ADB doesn't stream files – you have to pull the entire file. For large images, I had to implement chunked reading to check dimensions first.
4. Code Signing: Currently unsigned (requires $99/year Apple Developer membership). Users have to right-click → Open on first launch.

Open Source & Free

MIT licensed, no telemetry, no ads. Just a tool I wanted for myself.

Would love feedback! This is my first Tauri app after years of building Electron apps. The Rust learning curve was worth it – much smaller bundles and better performance for file I/O.
